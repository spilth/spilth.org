title: Holy Wars for Fortnite
---

<p class="lead">Holy Wars is a game type for Fortnite where Sinners scramble to claim Sainthood and score points for eliminations, while avoiding being cast down as a lowly Heretic.</p>

**Holy Wars is a recreation of the Quake 2 mod [Holy Wars](https://www.moddb.com/mods/holy-wars-quake-ii) by [Paolo "Nusco" Perrotta](https://twitter.com/nusco) and [Roberto "Taz" Bettazzoni](https://twitter.com/bettazzoni).**

## Sinners

When players first spawn they will all be Sinners - identified by an evil, red glow around them.

Sinners do not score points when eliminating other Sinners.

## The Saint

The first player to grab the Golden Shotgun at the center of the map will ascend and become The Saint! Only one player can be The Saint at any time and they will be identifiable by a heavenly, golden glow.

When you are The Saint you have increased Health and Shield. You also move a little bit faster than Sinners & Heretics, which is good because they will *all* be after you trying to take you out, steal the Golden Shotgun and claim Sainthood for themselves.

The Saint scores points when eliminating Sinners and Heretics.

## Heretics

If a Sinner eliminates too many other Sinners they become a Heretic. Heretics are slow and weak - meant to suffer for the infractions against their fellow sinners. They are identifiable by a sickly, green glow.

The only way to escape being a Heretic is being eliminated by The Saint or a Sinner.

The Saint and Sinners both score points for eliminating a Heretic.

## Scoring

- Becoming The Saint: 2 Points
- Saint eliminating Sinner: 1 Point
- Saint eliminating Heretic: 4 Points
- Sinner eliminating Sinner: 1 Heresy
- Sinner eliminating Saint: 3 Points
- Sinner eliminating Heretic:  3 Points
- Becoming a Heretic: -5 Points
- Heretic eliminating Saint: 0 Points
- Heretic eliminating Sinner: 0 Points

The player with the highest score at the end of the match is the winner. They do not have to be The Saint in order to win.
